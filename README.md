# ‚ö° **30 Days of JavaScript: JavaScript30 by Wes Bos**

Welcome to my **30 Days of JavaScript** challenge! This repository documents my journey through the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course by Wes Bos ‚Äî a hands-on series of 30 real projects using vanilla JavaScript. No libraries, no frameworks, no compilers ‚Äî just pure JS!

---

## üöÄ **Why This Challenge?**

- To go beyond theory and apply JavaScript in real mini-projects.
- To strengthen DOM manipulation, event handling, and core JS skills.
- To build 30 fun, useful, and interactive things in 30 days.
- To stay consistent and hands-on in my learning journey.
